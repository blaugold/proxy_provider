Flutter plugin for resolving network proxy configuration from system services or
custom providers.

# Installation

For Flutter apps, you need to install both [`proxy_provider`][proxy_provider]
and `proxy_provider_flutter`.

# Usage

You never need to import the `proxy_provider_flutter` package. This package
automatically registers a `systemProxyProvider` for the current platform.

See the [`proxy_provider`][proxy_provider] package for more information.
